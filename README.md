# üåæ A-Multi-Modal-Deep-Learning-Framework-for-Crop-Price-Prediction
## üìå Project Title
## A Multi-Modal Deep Learning Framework for Crop Price Prediction on Crop Price Prediction Dataset
# üìå Introduction
Agriculture forms the backbone of many economies, yet the sector remains highly vulnerable to price volatility driven by seasonal shifts, market dynamics, and unpredictable climate conditions. These fluctuations severely impact farmers' incomes, policymaking, and supply chain planning.

To address this challenge, our project introduces a Hybrid Deep Learning Framework that accurately predicts crop prices using a combination of:

Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM): Captures temporal patterns in historical price data.

XGBoost Regressor: Models non-linear residuals missed by deep learning.

SHAP Analysis: Provides interpretability by explaining the model‚Äôs decisions feature-wise.

# üéØ Why This Project?
To empower farmers and supply chain participants with data-driven price forecasts.

To mitigate risks posed by sudden price drops or surges.

To advance research in agri-tech machine learning solutions with a focus on interpretability and accuracy.

# üî¨ Core Features
Robust Preprocessing: Handles missing data, outliers, and categorical encoding.

Feature Engineering: Generates lags, rolling averages, and other temporal statistics.

Hybrid Modeling: Combines sequential and non-sequential learning for superior predictions.

Interpretability with SHAP: Transparent insights into feature contributions.

Performance Metrics: Evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤ score.

# üìä Dataset Source
We trained our model on the Crop Price Prediction Dataset from Kaggle, which contains detailed pricing records across different states, commodities, and periods.

### Project Details :

# üìä Problem Statement
Crop price volatility affects the livelihoods of millions of farmers, especially in countries like India where a majority depend on agriculture. Traditional models lack the capacity to capture temporal trends and complex interactions between multiple factors affecting crop prices.

Our project addresses this gap by building a hybrid deep learning framework that combines Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) for capturing temporal dependencies and XGBoost for modeling residuals, ensuring both predictive accuracy and interpretability using SHAP analysis.

# üéØ Objectives
Develop a hybrid architecture integrating BiLSTM (deep sequential learning) and XGBoost (nonlinear residual modeling).

Engineer robust features including lags, rolling statistics, and categorical encodings.

Evaluate the model using RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤ metrics.

Utilize SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for feature-level interpretability.

Provide a scalable solution adaptable to multiple crops and regions.
