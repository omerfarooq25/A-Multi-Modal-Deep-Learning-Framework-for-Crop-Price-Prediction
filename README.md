## ðŸ“Œ Project Title
## A Multi-Modal Deep Learning Framework for Crop Price Prediction on Crop Price Prediction Dataset
# ðŸ“Œ Introduction
Agriculture forms the backbone of many economies, yet the sector remains highly vulnerable to price volatility driven by seasonal shifts, market dynamics, and unpredictable climate conditions. These fluctuations severely impact farmers' incomes, policymaking, and supply chain planning.

To address this challenge, our project introduces a Hybrid Deep Learning Framework that accurately predicts crop prices using a combination of:

Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM): Captures temporal patterns in historical price data.

XGBoost Regressor: Models non-linear residuals missed by deep learning.

SHAP Analysis: Provides interpretability by explaining the modelâ€™s decisions feature-wise.

# ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project?
To empower farmers and supply chain participants with data-driven price forecasts.

To mitigate risks posed by sudden price drops or surges.

To advance research in agri-tech machine learning solutions with a focus on interpretability and accuracy.

# ðŸ”¬ Core Features
Robust Preprocessing: Handles missing data, outliers, and categorical encoding.

Feature Engineering: Generates lags, rolling averages, and other temporal statistics.

Hybrid Modeling: Combines sequential and non-sequential learning for superior predictions.

Interpretability with SHAP: Transparent insights into feature contributions.

Performance Metrics: Evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.

# ðŸ“Š Dataset Source
We trained our model on the Crop Price Prediction Dataset from Kaggle, which contains detailed pricing records across different states, commodities, and periods.
